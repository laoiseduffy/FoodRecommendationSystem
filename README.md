# Bia Athlete

A recipe recommendation system that aims to improve athletic performance through good nutrition. The recommendation system classifies recipes into 4 categories: pre-exercise, post exercise, recovery day, and healthy. These categories provide athletes with recipe suggestions that will help their performance by ensuring they fuel correctly, accelerate the repair of damaged muscle tissue, and reduce inflammation. This is achieved through the use of machine learning techniques to classify the recipes and the creation of a web application to display the recipes.
